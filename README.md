# Hello

Welcome to my personal portfolio! In this repository you can find all of my web pages for the personal site, portfolio, blog, and other project.

## Structure

`/blog`: My blog, this is where I post all kinds of development related stuff that interests me.

`/projects`: Projects that I have made / worked on.

`/pages`: Different pages on my personal website, contains more information about me and what I can do.

## Why

I made this site to learn how to work on different UIs and make sure that the user experience on all platforms is great. Here I can also experiment with different web technologies, learn DevOps, learn how to manage and deploy different things, and most importantly... DEVELOP NEW THINGS!

I love working on new stuff and learning new things, that's why I made this site, as a place to test and experiment all while also putting it available for others to view so they can see my journey through the world of software development.
